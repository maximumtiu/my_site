      I'm running solo at
      %a{:href => "http://fittery.com"} Fittery,
      where I'm writing and maintaining multiple projects including Rails apps, Ruby gems, and JS apps and libraries. I'm learning and growing rapidly and it's so genuinely exhilarating.
    %li
      I'm on the board of directors for
      %a{:href => "http://railsgirlsatl.github.io"} Rails Girls Atlanta,
      where I serve as Communications Coordinator and get the joy of talking with and writing for inspiring, exciting women that love code.
    %li
      I've founded and am the co-organizer for Ladies of Tech Talent South, a women's group with the TTS bootcamp that acknowledges how difficult it is for women to enter tech and aims to provide a safe space for socializing, studying, and supporting each other.
    %li
      I'm in an awesome book club for growing developers where we're currently reading Hoover and Oshineye's

    %li
      I get to snuggle and play with

      every day.
