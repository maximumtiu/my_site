  %p#now Here's what I'm up to now:
  %ul
    %li
      I'm working for
      %a{href: 'https://callrail.com'} CallRail
      where I spend most of my days using Ruby to build complex inventory management and call routing systems. I also run a developer apprenticeship program at CallRail, helping grow two developing developers. If you've got thoughts on teaching and guiding new devs, I'd love to chat!
    %li
      I've got a new talk called "The Practical Guide to Building an Apprenticeship" based on my experience creating and running the apprenticeship at CallRail. If you are (or know) a conference organizer that's interested in having this talk at your conference, please
      %a{href: '/contact'} get in touch!
    %li
      I'm on the board of directors for
      %a{:href => "http://railsgirlsatl.github.io"} Rails Girls Atlanta,
      where I serve as Communications Coordinator and get the joy of talking with and writing for inspiring, exciting women that love code.
    %li
      I'm in a wonderful book club for ever-growing developers where we recently finish reading Sandi Metz's Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby and have begun Martin Fowler's Refactoring.
    %li
      I get to snuggle and play with
      %a{:href => "https://www.instagram.com/p/1jWocBx4nk/"} this amazing beast
      every day.
