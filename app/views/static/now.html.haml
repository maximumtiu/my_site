  %p#now Here's what I'm up to now:
  %ul
    %li
      I'm now working for
      %a{href: 'https://callrail.com'} CallRail
      where I spend most of my days using Ruby to build complex inventory management and call routing systems. I'm also building a developer apprenticeship program at CallRail. If you've got thoughts on teaching and guiding new developers, I'd love to chat!
    %li
      I'll be giving a talk on learning to love the less-glamorous parts of web development at
      %a{href: 'https://werise.tech/'} We Rise
      in Atlanta this June and at
      %a{href: 'https://windycityrails.com/'} WindyCityRails
      in Chicago this September.
    %li
      I'm on the board of directors for
      %a{:href => "http://railsgirlsatl.github.io"} Rails Girls Atlanta,
      where I serve as Communications Coordinator and get the joy of talking with and writing for inspiring, exciting women that love code.
    %li
      I'm in a wonderful book club for ever-growing developers where we're reading Sandi Metz's Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby.
    %li
      I get to snuggle and play with
      %a{:href => "https://www.instagram.com/p/1jWocBx4nk/"} this amazing beast
      every day.
