  <ul>
    <li>I'm half of the two-person development team at 
      <a href="http://fittery.com">Fittery</a>,
      where I'm constantly learning new things, growing, and getting my paws on as much fun stuff as possible.

    <li>I'm on the board of directors for 
      <a href="http://railsgirlsatl.github.io">Rails Girls Atlanta</a>,
      where I serve as Communications Coordinator and get the joy of talking with and writing to inspiring, exciting women that love code.
    </li>

    <li>
      I've founded and am the co-organizer for Ladies of Tech Talent South, a women's group with the TTS bootcamp that acknowledges how difficult it is for women to enter tech and aims to provide a safe space for socializing, studying, and supporting each other.
    </li>

    <li>
      I'm in an awesome book club for junior developers where we're currently reading Hoover and Oshineye's
