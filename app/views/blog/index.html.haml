          Here we are: my first installment for the #BlogBuddies blog with
          %a{href: "http://locrawfish.github.io/"} my buddy Loren!
          My goal for this series,
          %a{href: "/blog/3/blog-buddies"} (as outlined here),
          is to share what I'm learning on a weekly basis with others--be it lessons in teamwork, new workflow techniques, or fun little hacks--and to have a record of my progress. This week, 
          %span.heavier I worked with cookies for the first time.
        %p.body 
          Until I started work on one of our company's new Javascript-based projects, I had never really thought about, much less used, cookies. I'd always assumed (mostly out of ignorance), that cookies would be difficult to use effectively. This week, I was very happy to be proved wrong.

        %p.body Learning is fun. But when you learn a lot at once, it's hard to keep track of all the things you learn in a given time.
        %p.body I've had this blog for a while now, yet at a whopping count of two posts, I clearly haven't been utilizing it properly. Thanks to some inspiration by some friends and our book club, this changes now!

        %h2.title On the Importance of Side Projects

          Today, I got to spend time with a group of awesome, inspiring women in the Atlanta tech scene away from work, away from meetups, and away from any rigid structure. Bringing us together was the goal of completing burgeoning or neglected side projects, often sidetracked as work and life get in the way. As we sat quietly coding, sipping coffee, and munching on pastries, a light flickered on in my head:
          %strong I truly love what I do.

        %p.body As the summer draws to a close, I am now finishing up Tech Talent South’s summer full-time Code Immersion program. It’s been an absolutely amazing 8 weeks and I don’t think I could have previously fathomed how much I’ve grown and learned in such a short amount of time. If you’re thinking of starting a coding bootcamp soon, perhaps here at Tech Talent South, I absolutely recommend it, especially if you’re eager to learn new things and want to break into the tech industry. At the risk of sounding like a Buzzfeed-esque listicle, here are some tips from me to you to make your journey as smooth as possible.
