        %p.body The world of HTTP is vast! GET and POST are by far the most popular type of requests, but they'll only get you so far. Until recently, the only instances I'd ever really needed to use methods other than GET and POST were server-side while consuming others' APIs; this never proved to be an issue. Lately, however, I've been making more API requests from my own client-side apps, which has brought along some unique challenges. What if you need to update a resource? Meet PUT and PATCH.

        %p.body At time of writing, I've been studying and practicing web development for roughly a year. In that time, I've gone from nervous, questioning, and anxious about my future to firmly planted in a career I love. In June of last year, I introduced myself to modern HTML & CSS (the skills I learned as a 10-year-old weren't going to cut it in a professional setting). In July, I started writing Ruby. I went through a web dev bootcamp. I learned to use Rails, Javascript, git. I learned to work on a team, debug my code, and explore the vast world of programming. In September, I started my first full-time development job.
        %p.body Nine months later, I'm my company's technical lead. I'm also the most junior person there. I'm also the only developer, period. A team of one.

          %em Of course you do.
          Thankfully, you're in luck!
          %code.inline Enumerable
          is included anywhere you can use an
          %code.inline #each
          method. Arrays? Yup. Hashes? You bet. You can even use it in your own custom classes. Discovering this module was a big level-up for me–all of a sudden, I could accomplish more in fewer lines of code. I could read my data-concerned code easier. I could lift a horse with my newfound power! (Okay, that last one's probably not true. But still, the Enumerable module is pretty great.)
        %p.body Here are a few of my favorite ways to use the Enumerable module:

          My goal for this series,
          %a{href: "/blog/3/blog-buddies"} (as outlined here),
          is to share what I'm learning on a weekly basis with others--be it lessons in teamwork, new workflow techniques, or fun little hacks--and to have a record of my progress. This week, 
          %span.heavier I worked with cookies for the first time.
        %p.body 
          Until I started work on one of our company's new Javascript-based projects, I had never really thought about, much less used, cookies. I'd always assumed (mostly out of ignorance), that cookies would be difficult to use effectively. This week, I was very happy to be proved wrong.

        %p.body Learning is fun. But when you learn a lot at once, it's hard to keep track of all the things you learn in a given time.
        %p.body I've had this blog for a while now, yet at a whopping count of two posts, I clearly haven't been utilizing it properly. Thanks to some inspiration by some friends and our book club, this changes now!

          Today, I got to spend time with a group of awesome, inspiring women in the Atlanta tech scene away from work, away from meetups, and away from any rigid structure. Bringing us together was the goal of completing burgeoning or neglected side projects, often sidetracked as work and life get in the way. As we sat quietly coding, sipping coffee, and munching on pastries, a light flickered on in my head:

        %p.body As the summer draws to a close, I am now finishing up Tech Talent South’s summer full-time Code Immersion program. It’s been an absolutely amazing 8 weeks and I don’t think I could have previously fathomed how much I’ve grown and learned in such a short amount of time. If you’re thinking of starting a coding bootcamp soon, perhaps here at Tech Talent South, I absolutely recommend it, especially if you’re eager to learn new things and want to break into the tech industry. At the risk of sounding like a Buzzfeed-esque listicle, here are some tips from me to you to make your journey as smooth as possible.
