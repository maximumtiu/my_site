        %p.body Learning is fun. But when you learn a lot at once, it's hard to keep track of all the things you learn in a given time.
        %p.body I've had this blog for a while now, yet at a whopping count of two posts, I clearly haven't been utilizing it properly. Thanks to some inspiration by some friends and our book club, this changes now!

        %p.body As the summer draws to a close, I am now finishing up Tech Talent South’s summer full-time Code Immersion program. It’s been an absolutely amazing 8 weeks and I don’t think I could have previously fathomed how much I’ve grown and learned in such a short amount of time.
